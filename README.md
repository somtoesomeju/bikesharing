# Bikesharing

# Overview and Purpose
In this project, I am using Tableau to visualize bike rider data in Des Moines, Iowa. The reason is to make a proposal to stakeholders that a bike-sharing app (like uber) would be a great idea. 

# Resources
- Software: Tableau Public 2021.3.0, Jupyter notebook 3.4.10
- Languages: Python, Tableau.

# Results
A link to my visualization story is seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/somto.esomeju/viz/CitibikeAnalysis_16332344618750/Story1). 
- From my analysis, it is seen that a majority of bikeriders are not on the road for very long. The average trip is typically less than 20 minutes. This is seen from the checkout times by users visualization in my story. 

- Another visualization shows that majority of riders are on the road around 8AM in the morning, and 6PM in the evening. This corresponds with rush hour, showing that majority of bike riders use bicycles to get to work. 

- Men also count for the majority of riders, compared to women. 

- Majority of riders are on the road on Thursdays. The reason why is unknown.

In conclusion, the visualizations certainly paint a picture, that there are a lot of people using bicycles on the streets. A bike-sharing app would be a great idea as it would help riders know the next available bike-sharing station closest to them. This would make it easier for users to plan out their daily commutes through the city.
